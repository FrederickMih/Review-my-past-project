          When he first saw implementations of instant messaging, Dorsey
          wondered whether the software's user status output could be shared
          easily among friends.[10] He approached Odeo, which at the time
          happened to be interested in text messaging.[10] Dorsey and Biz Stone
          decided that SMS text suited the status-message idea, and built a
          prototype of Twitter in about two weeks.[10] The idea attracted many
          users at Odeo and investment from Evan Williams,[10] a co-founder of
          that firm in 2005 who had left Google after selling Pyra Labs and
          Blogger.
